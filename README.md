## Belief

My knowledge should be so extensive that I don't need to prepare for interviews.

## How my day starts

I woke up and went to make myself a coffee. While making coffee, I was thinking about what can I do today. I remembered that I was reading about data streaming. I wanted to fetch data from multiple sources. Let's say three to five HTTP sources. The received data gets written to the response stream. The client reads the data and can prioritize which data to fetch. The client should show feedback about the received data.

## Reading

Google knows me so well that I receive notifications 24/7 about tech news.

- Anything interesting
- Data streaming
- How to write good git history
- A friend impressed me by using terminal and vim, no mouse - only keyboard. I tried using it, and it feels great to forget about the mouse.
- C++ - Smart pointers, memory leaks, pointer use cases, inheritance, and polymorphism - virtual, etc.
- Anything related to tech, I don't care.

## Activity

I want to learn everything there is.
