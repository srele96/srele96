# Srecko Kostic

I am a software developer professionally and for fun.

## Philosophy

I need to understand the tools I use to get creative.

## Learning method

I will learn anything that is interesting. My area of interest is not specific, but my latest area of interest can be seen on my GitHub profile activity.

As I am thinking and have a sudden thought: "Code splitting - Chunks, are requested by GET request. I saw the GET request in the network tab. If chunks are requested with HTTP, they are regular files. Because chunks are regular files I can simulate module environment by adding a script tag when I need it.". Then i most often try it out.

## I like to read

I am reading blogs, browsing the web, and try to implement cool stuff.

Whenever I think of some topic that might be interesting I have to try it.

Last couple of them were:

- Code splitting - I was trying to figure out how did the webpack implement it. First I tried to implement it on my own. I realized that code splitting is on-demand requesting more javascript files. I had some problems and inspected the page built by webpack. While inspecting the page I realized they store chunk names in the global window object and request them by adding a script tag that points to the chunk. Amazing.
- Invariants - I started learning algorithms and data structures. One of the first topics was about invariants and their usage in computer science. After two months of having them in my head - passive learning, i figured them out. Invariants are truthiness assertions that we use in computer science every day.

## Activity

I am learning a couple of topics:

- Data streaming. Improving the data transmittion ecosystem.
- How do the client and backend apps work together.
- Web development tooling narrowed to JavaScript ecosystem.
  - Bundlers
  - Transpilers
  - Linters
  - Type checkers
  - Formatters
  - Bundle optimizations
  - HTTP
  - Optimization of client-side applications
- I am interested in other topics like C++, Python, Backend, Serverless, etc.
